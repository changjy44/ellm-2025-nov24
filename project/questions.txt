19.  Myxomatosis is a viral disease of rabbits. It spreads rapidly and most rabbits die within 14 days of being infected. Myxomatosis has been deliberately used to reduce the number of rabbits in countries where they are a significant crop pest. The initial release of the virus caused populations to fall by over 90%.

Which of the following statements could explain the increasing frequency of resistance to myxomatosis in the years following release of the virus?
1 In populations with high incidences of myxomatosis, mutations leading to resistance are more likely to occur.
2 Infected rabbits die quickly, hence the alleles that code for myxomatosis are eliminated from the population.

29. Researchers investigated the genus Heliconius which contains more than 40 species of 
butterflies and found the following. 
• H. cydno and H. melpomene produce fertile hybrid offspring, which after some 
generations of mating amongst themselves, forms H. heurippa. 
• H. heurippa has an intermediate phenotype between the parental species, and 
prefer to mate with each other, rather than individuals of either parent species. 
• Heliconius butterflies taste unpleasant to predators and its wing coloration acts as 
warnings to predators. Each individual predator has to learn which patterns to avoid.
