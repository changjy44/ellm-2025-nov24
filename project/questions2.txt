An unknown organism has a linear double-stranded DNA genome like that in a
eukaryote. When its DNA replication was examined, it was revealed that although the
process is semi-conservative, no Okazaki fragments were observed in the multiple
replication forks. In addition, the end-replication problem of shortened daughter strands
was not observed. 
What correctly explains this phenomenon?
[OPTION] The organism’s DNA is antiparallel.
[OPTION] DNA replication only starts at the 3’ end of each template strand.
[OPTION] DNA polymerases synthesise DNA in both 5’ to 3’ and 3’ to 5’ direction.
[OPTION] DNA ligases are not involved in the DNA replication process.

Is this statement about tRNA true or false? 
[TRUTH] True
[STATEMENT] There is a binding site for the attachment of a specific amino acid, as well as a
different binding site for the attachment to the ribosome, in order to allow
translation to occur.
[STATEMENT] There is a ribose-phosphate backbone with strong covalent phosphoester bonds
and areas within the polynucleotide chain where base-pairing by hydrogen
bonding occurs.
[STATEMENT] There is a section known as an anticodon that contains the same triplet of bases
as the triplet of DNA bases that has been transcribed to produce the mRNA
codon.
[STATEMENT] There is a specific enzyme to load each tRNA with its respective amino acid.

Is this statement about eukaryotic gene expression true or false?
[TRUTH] True
[STATEMENT]  By binding to the 5’ UTR of an mRNA, a translational regulatory protein blocks the
initiation of translation.
[STATEMENT]  Having a relatively shorter mRNA half-life allows more rapid control of gene
expression at the translational level.
[STATEMENT]  Different transcription factors help the same RNA polymerase recognise different
promoters.
[STATEMENT] By binding to the 3’ UTR of the mRNA, a translational regulatory protein increases
the stability of an mRNA.
[OPTION] 1 only
[OPTION] 1 and 3
[OPTION] 2 and 4
[OPTION] 1, 3 and 4

Is this statement about transcription in eukaryotes true or false?
[TRUTH] False
[STATEMENT] Specific sequences found near the promoter may increase the affinity of RNA
polymerase binding, thus increases the probability of forming transcription
initiation complex.
[STATEMENT] RNA polymerase, general transcription factors and specific transcription factors
make up the transcription initiation complex.
[STATEMENT] Specific transcription factors such as repressors bind to silencers to prevent
assembly of the transcription initiation complex.
[STATEMENT] The binding of enhancer proteins to activators results in enhanced rate of
transcription.
